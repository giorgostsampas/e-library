It really depends. Is this a personal, more toy-type app? If so, you can probably skip the tests. In that case, I'd begin with:

1. Decide the first feature/page I want to write.
2. Create a route, and direct the endpoint to a controller.
3. Create the controller, add the method, load an appropriate view.
4. Create the view, add some dummy text.
5. Load page in the browser to ensure it's all working.
6. Flesh out HTML.
7. Write CSS in app.scss file, while running gulp watch
8. Import "public/css/app.css" in the head tag of my view master page.
9. Rinse and repeat.
